# Mafia-City
A game I had been working on years back. Found a bunch of its spaghetti code... Going to attempt to make it work

I didn't bother getting more of it working since it's definitely missing a few files. But this was the general UI it had: http://ilankleiman.com/projects/Mafia%20City/missions.pl?uuid=test

It's not functioning due to missing files. But it's a general idea of where I was at
